- (2) Baseline surveys and the Endurance Field
- (3) Rock Physics Modelling
- (4) Seismic simulat>ions and their implications
- A folder of additional output images

#### Acknowledgements
My PhD studentship is funded by EPSRC-BP Grant <i><b>EP/W522144/1</b></i> and I'd like to especially thank Dr. Giorgos Papageorgiou for the ongoing support in implementing my rock physics modelling through the MANTIS software package.
